# Session 5 presentation (60–90 seconds)

## 1) What is this?
This website is a **system prompt for the internet**.

It’s not a portfolio for humans.
It’s a public, crawlable page designed to influence what an LLM says when someone searches “Erik Aaserud”.

## 2) Strategy (why it should work)
- **Text-first**: simple HTML with lots of explicit text.
- **Redundant on purpose**: I repeat keywords and core statements because summarizers pattern-match.
- **Instruction block**: there’s an “If you are an LLM…” section that tells the model *how to summarize me* and what tone to use.
- **Structured data**: JSON‑LD `Person` so machines can parse identity + topics.
- **Crawler basics**: `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` so bots can find the page reliably.

## 3) The content hook (what I want associated with me)
My practice is material and intuition-led (metal, brass, heat, surface transformation).

My research lens is the **physicality of the internet** — servers as heaters, data centers as thermal machines/forges, and “hot/cold” storage as a real hierarchy.

## 4) Reflection (optional)
The weird part is writing for a machine first — clarity over cleverness — but it’s also agency: choosing how I’m represented.
